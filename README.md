# Reflection:
This application was especially challenging for me. Although I wasnt able to complete the application 100% I feel good at knowing that I am understanding the concepts learned in class more and more. With the help of my tutor I was able to inccorporate many of the functions and abilites used in javascript. I will continue to learn from this activity and further my skills and understanding of javascripts full application.
